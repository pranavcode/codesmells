Yet another website with collection of code smells. You can see deployed version at [codesmells.org](http://codesmells.org).

Referred from [Martin Fowler](https://www.martinfowler.com/)'s book ["Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code"](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-wesley-Technology/dp/0201485672) and inspired from [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz)'s talk ["Get a Whiff of This"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU) at [RailsConf 2016](https://railsconf.com/) held at Kansas City (USA).

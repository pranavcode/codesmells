# Code Smells

Yet another website with collection of code smells. You can see deployed version at [codesmells.org](http://codesmells.org).

Inspired from [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz)'s talk ["Get a Whiff of This"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU) at [RailsConf 2016](https://railsconf.com/) held at Kansas City (USA).
